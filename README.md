# Car-Price-Prediction
This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using a variety of features. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of car listings and employs a regression model to estimate the price of a car based on its attributes.
## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
-`sample.csv`:This directory houses the dataset used for training and evaluation purposes. It comprises car listings with pertinent attributes, including make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant information.
-`trained_model.sav`: This file is a serialized version of the trained machine learning model for car price prediction.
